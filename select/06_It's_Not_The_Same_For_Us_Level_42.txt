I know you live on my street
I sometimes wonder
Why we don't meet
I've seen your face in the sky
Twenty-five stories high
You never come down to earth
Communication (communication)
Could hardly be much worse
Don't keep me here in the dark
I want to be your friend
Your fears are way off the mark

Every generation (woah, woah, woah)
Sees it their own way (woah, woah, woah)
Never learning their lessons (woah, woah, woah)
Making the same mistakes again

It's not the same for us, as history fades away
It's not the same for us
It's not the same for us, you must hear me when I say
It's not the same for us

Look out on this brave new land
Think of the future
The future that lays in our hands
Our leaders live in the past
We can change it
There's something to hope for at last

Every generation (woah, woah, woah)
Sees it their own way (woah, woah, woah)
I thought we learnt our lessons (woah, woah, woah)
Don't make the same mistakes again

It's not the same for us, as history fades away
It's not the same for us
It's not the same for us, do you hear me when I say
It's not the same for us

(It's not the same for us)
What dreams are you chasing now?
What are you living for?
(It's not the same for us)
The problems that we're facing now
Nobody faced before
(It's not the same for us)
Please don't reject me
In anger or in sorrow
(It's not the same for us)
You've got to accept me
If we're to make a better tomorrow

It's not, the same, it's not the same for us
It's not, the same, it's not the same for us
It's not, the same, it's not the same for us
It's not, the same, it's not the same for us
