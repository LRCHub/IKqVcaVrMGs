My life been going so smooth
I tell that bitch wanna move like a robot
Already paid all my dues
Two thousand on shoes, know I'm getting paid to go out
I turned the trap to a ho house
Got so many pounds, this bitch look like a grow house
Now I be selling out shows
And I put that shit on just to show up and show out
We not the same, we the opposite
Walk in the mall, if I want it, I'm copping it
Niggas ain't nothing like us when we popping it
Put all the love in the roof 'cause I'm dropping it
Whole lot of pain right inside of my eyes
I can't let you hurt my heart, I'm tired of trying
If we go to war, I'm in front of the line
Everywhere that I go, gotta ride with that iron

Stay on my ten, gotta stay on my feet
Say they can't stand me, well just take a seat
Way before rapping, bitch, I was a beast
Got too many hoes from the North to the East
One thing that I cannot stand is a leech
Can't bring no sand to the beach
If I hit a lick, I'ma split it with all of my partners
And bring it back then we gon' feast
Used to be broke, but now bitch, I'm paid
Can't make no minimum wage
I done got caught in the spot when they raided
Popping these Percocets, bitch, I be faded
Put that shit on, I be rocking the latest
I honestly don't need a stylist
I'm in LA right now, I just be vibing
Money keep coming in, I got a pilot
I just been working and grinding, it ain't no way I could fall
Bitches be saying I'm a dog 'cause
I just be working, I barely even call
I love my fans, I be giving it raw,
Couldn't do this shit without y'all
She let me fuck, I'ma beat up her walls,
She know I like when she don't wear no drawers

My life been going so smooth
I tell that bitch wanna move like a robot
Already paid all my dues
Two thousand on shoes, know I'm getting paid to go out
I turned the trap to a ho house
Got so many pounds, this bitch look like a grow house
Now I be selling out shows
And I put that shit on just to show up and show out
We not the same, we the opposite
Walk in the mall, if I want it, I'm copping it
Niggas ain't nothing like us when we popping it
Put all the love in the roof 'cause I'm dropping it
Whole lot of pain right inside of my eyes
I can't let you hurt my heart, I'm tired of trying
If we go to war, I'm in front of the line
Everywhere that I go, gotta ride with that iron

AK-47, I ride with a 9
Get in trouble, he get popped with that iron
Mathematics and I dropped out in ninth grade
I was too busy riding with that iron
Hard to see niggas around me smile
Hard to see niggas around me go down, hey
I got Chanel and Burberry towels when I wipe down, yeah
I just put a half a million dollars on his head
I just put a whole hundred rounds on FN
I just put my nut inside her mouth and not her skin
I just put Burberry on the couch and it was red
I don't never ever hear what pussy niggas said
I just wanna see his mama crying 'cause he dead
Eight LA bitches with me now, Kobe Bryant
When I pass away, my kids get my sound, yeah

My life been going so smooth
I tell that bitch wanna move like a robot
Already paid all my dues
Two thousand on shoes, know I'm getting paid to go out
I turned the trap to a ho house
Got so many pounds, this bitch look like a grow house
