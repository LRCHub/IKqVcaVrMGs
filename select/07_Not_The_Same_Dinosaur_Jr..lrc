[00:18.94] On this day, where you're so messed it's clear
[00:24.38] Can't explain the road you roam
[00:29.74] Anyone, who's been
[00:38.74] 
[00:36.91] As I walk with you, it chills me so
[00:42.37] To hear you say, it's gone the worse, so I cared
[01:13.02] Here I dream, I always talked to you
[01:31.02] 
[01:18.42] You seem fine again, my sweet
[01:22.94] Feels alright to me
[01:28.36] Is it right for you?
[01:38.36] 
[01:31.07] Flippin' out I try to call to you, till you come to me
[01:40.09] Tell me, what to do?
[02:07.18] And I know it's not the same, there's no blame
[02:30.18] 
[02:13.43] But still I bother you
[02:16.12] And you say it's not true, dear, it's mine to fear
[02:22.48] Follow through
[02:42.38] Come alive, I know you'll sing with me
[03:01.38] 
[02:47.70] I won't sing to you, it's not a thing I do
[02:59.40] How's it been a different feel for you?
[03:18.90] 
[03:04.86] Wholesomeness was gone along
[03:09.33] Or is it something new?
[03:16.66] And I know it's not the same, there's no blame
[03:39.66] 
[03:23.82] But still I bother you
[03:25.65] And you say, it's not true dear, it's mine to fear
[03:31.95] We won't coexist
[03:34.68] Anyway you're not the same, it's the blame
[03:55.68] 
[03:45.47] Follow through
[04:04.36] It's a lingering that comes through me
[04:23.36] 
[04:09.87] Does it come to you?
[04:14.36] Are we really through?
[04:21.53] Any guy would do this thing for me
[04:26.92] It's not much to ask
[04:31.45] Why can't you?
[04:38.64] I'm not gonna say, I've had my way
[04:44.18] You should solve it out
[04:48.65] What else can I do?
[04:55.89] You promised so much, lied with every touch
[05:01.22] I believed in you
[05:10.28] Follow through
