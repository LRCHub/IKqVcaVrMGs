On this day where you're so messed it's clear
Can't explain the (world you roam?)
Anyone who's been
As I walk with you, It chills me so
To hear you say "It's come to this"
And the (rats I've killed!)
In a dream, I always talk to you
You seem fine again, my sweet
Feels alright to me
Is it right for you?
Flippin' out I try to call to you
Til' you come to me
Tell me what to do
And I know it's not the same, there's no blame
(Still I bother you)
And you say it's not your deal, it's mine to fear(feel?)
(Follow along, ?)
Come on out(alive?) I know you'll sing with me
I won't sing to you
It's not a thing I do
Has it been a different feel for you?
Wholesomeness was gone along
Is it something new?
And I know it's now the same, there's no blame
(Still I bother you)
And you say it's not true, dear, it's mine to fear
(We won't coexist)(I'm coming through ?)
Any way you're not the same, it's the pain (blame?)
(Follow along, son)(follow through)?
It's so angering that comes to me
Does it come to you?
Are we really through ?
Any guy would do this thing for me
It's not much to ask
Why can't you?
I'm not gonna say I've had my way
You sure saw to that
What else can I do?
You promised so much, lied with every touch
I believed in you.
