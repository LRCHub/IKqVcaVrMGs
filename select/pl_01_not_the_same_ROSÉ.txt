Say what you want to, babe
But you know that you're talking in circles
Tell me lies, like we okay
Promise till your face turns purple
That you gon’ love me, love me
One day you gon' love me right
Shame on me for
Trusting you once, trusting you twice
Yeah, we had
Only and nothing but time
But some things just change overnight
I don't know who you think you’re kidding, babe
Yeah, you're not the same
Not the same
Yeah, we had
Good days and light on our side
But you fucked up and
You know that I'm right
I don't know who you think you're kidding, babe
Yеah, you're not the same
Not thе same
Not the same
Pick it up, up
Drop your keys
Come get your stuff, yeah
Find a new heart to confide in
Did letting me down get tiring?
I keep on walking through
All of the memories that I had with you
And I don't miss it
The way you felt my love
Yeah, we had
Only and nothing but time
But some things just change overnight
I don't know who you think you’re kidding, babe
Yeah, you're not the same
Not the same
Yeah, we had
Good days and light on our side
But you fucked up and
You know that I'm right
I don't know who you think you're kidding, babe
Yеah, you're not the same
Not thе same
Not the same
Oh, what a shame
Nothing's the same
All of my love, you put it to waste
And you can keep pointing the finger
Thought it’d be us, go figure
Yeah, we had
Only and nothing but time
But some things just change overnight
I don't know who you think you’re kidding, babe
Yeah, you're not the same
Not the same
Yeah, we had
Good days and light on our side
But you fucked up and
You know that I'm right
I don't know who you think you're kidding, babe
